# Natural-Langauge-Processing-
Garden Path Sentences using spaCy

In this task I implemented tokenization and NER(Named Entity Recognition) using spaCy. With tokenization, 
I broke my texts into words or symbols whilst NER made it possible to identify proper nouns, dates,organizations etc. Ultimately,
spaCy helped me to interpret confusing sentences.
